### About

Hi, I'm @LinuxSquare and a fellow Linux-nerd using Arch Linux as a daily driver at home and at work.
I code alot in Bash, Kotlin and recently creating websites using Hugo and TailwindCSS.

Currently I'm not interested in contributing anywhere, besides filing bugreports.

All my code is stored on GitHub's competitor.
